# 🤖 AI Interview Coach  

An AI-powered mock interview platform that helps candidates **practice interviews** and **get instant feedback**.  
Built with **Streamlit (frontend)**, **FastAPI (backend)**, **LLaMA 2** for question generation, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for role-specific knowledge.  

---

## 🔹 Features  
- 🎯 **Role-based Interviews** → User enters a role (e.g., Data Analyst, Software Engineer, ML Engineer) and gets realistic interview questions.  
- 🧠 **RAG-Powered Question Bank** → Questions are retrieved from curated datasets, ensuring they’re relevant to the chosen role.  
- 💬 **Mock Interview Simulation** → Step-by-step Q&A flow like a real interview.  
- ✅ **AI Feedback** → Instant evaluation of answers with strengths, improvements, and sample suggestions.  
- ⚡ **Simple UI** → Clean, interactive interface built with Streamlit.
